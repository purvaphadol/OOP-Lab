# **OOP Lab**

This repository contains a series of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignments implemented in C++ as per the lab syllabus prescribed by the Pune University (SPPU). 
## Assignments Overview

### **1. Complex Number Class**
- **Description**: Implementation of a Complex class that supports basic operations for complex numbers, including addition, multiplication, and input/output operations.
- **File**: `OOPA1.cpp`

### **2. Student Information System**
- **Description**: Development of a student database system featuring constructors, destructors, static member functions, friend classes, and dynamic memory allocation for managing student information.
- **File**: `OOPA2.cpp`

### **3. Publication System**
- **Description**: Creation of a publication system with a base Publication class and derived Book and Tape classes, demonstrating inheritance, exception handling, and virtual functions for data entry and display.
- **File**: `OOPA3.cpp`

### **4. File Handling**
- **Description**: Implementation of file handling operations, including creating, writing, reading, and appending to files to manage student details and file content.
- **File**: `OOPA4.cpp`

### **5. Selection Sort Template**
- **Description**: A function template for selection sort that handles different data types (int, float, char, string), showcasing template classes and functions for sorting and displaying arrays.
- **File**: `OOPA5.cpp`

### **6. Item Records with STL**
- **Description**: C++ program using STL for sorting and searching user-defined item records, which include item code, name, cost, and quantity, utilizing vector containers.
- **File**: `OOPA6.cpp`

### **7. State Population Map**
- **Description**: C++ program using the map associative container to store and retrieve state populations. The user can enter state names and populations, view all entries, and search for a stateâ€™s population.
- **File**: `OOPA7.cpp`

## Prerequisites
- **C++ compiler** (e.g., GCC)
